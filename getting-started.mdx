Visibl is an AI-powered platform for silicon engineering teams. We provide enterprise-grade tools that accelerate chip design, verification, and documentationâ€”while preserving security and control on your infrastructure.


## Deploy the LLM service

Start by deploying the AI infrastructure on your server. This provides the local, secure AI processing power.

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose and install your model">
Select the model that best fits your needs:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Visibl Fast (7B)">
Perfect for day-to-day development:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://visiblsemi.com/api/install-llm?model=fast" | sudo bash
```

- Single GPU (24GB+ VRAM)
- Low latency responses
- Code completion and debugging
</Tab>

<Tab title="Visibl Heavy (70B)">
Best for complex reasoning:

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://visiblsemi.com/api/install-llm?model=heavy" | sudo bash
```

- Dual GPU (2x A100 recommended)
- Advanced architecture decisions
- Complex verification planning
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This automatically validates system requirements, installs NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and starts the service on port 58180.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify deployment">
Check that your service is running:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:58180/health
```

<Check>
You should see`{"status": "healthy", "model": "visibl-70b"}`from the health check.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Install the CLI tool

With the LLM service running, install the CLI on your development workstation:

```bash
# One-line installer
curl -fsSL https://visiblsemi.com/api/install | bash
```

The CLI automatically discovers and connects to your local LLM service.

### Test the installation

Verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check version and connection
visibl --version

# Test AI assistance
visibl run "Hello, can you help me with RTL design?"
```

<Check>
You should get a helpful response about RTL design assistance, confirming the CLI is connected to your local AI service.
</Check>

## Start building with AI

You're now ready to use Visibl for silicon engineering tasks:


```bash
cd your-workspace-root/
visibl
```

Then chat naturally:
```
> I'm designing a memory controller for DDR4. Can you help me with the refresh logic?
> Now I need to add support for different burst lengths. How should I modify the state machine?
> Can you generate testcases to verify the refresh timing requirements?
```

### Generate RTL modules

```bash
# Create a parameterized FIFO
visibl run "Create a parameterized FIFO module with configurable width and depth, proper reset handling, and gray code pointers"

# Generate an AXI interface
visibl run "Generate an AXI4-Lite slave interface for a register bank with 16 32-bit registers"

# Clock domain crossing
visibl run "Create a safe multi-bit clock domain crossing circuit using gray code counters"
```

### Create verification assets

```bash
# UVM testbench
visibl run "Create a UVM testbench for my UART module with agent, scoreboard, and coverage model"

# SystemVerilog assertions
visibl run "Generate SystemVerilog assertions for AXI4 handshake protocol validation"

# Coverage model
visibl run "Build functional coverage for my cache controller covering hit/miss scenarios"
```


## Project setup

For best results, initialize Visibl in your RTL projects:

1. **Navigate to your project**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/rtl/project
   ```

2. **Initialize Visibl**
   ```bash
   visibl init
   ```

This analyzes your codebase and generates an `AGENTS.md` file with project-specific guidelines.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="LLM service won't start">
    **Check GPU visibility:**
    ```bash
    nvidia-smi
    ```
    
    **Restart Docker service:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```
    
    **Check service logs:**
    ```bash
    visibl-llm logs
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="CLI can't connect to service">
    **Verify service is running:**
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:58180/health
    ```
    
    **Check CLI configuration:**
    ```bash
    visibl config show
    ```
    
    **Manual configuration:**
    ```bash
    visibl config set-llm-endpoint YOUR_SERVER_IP:58180
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Out of memory errors">

    visibl-llm util 0.85
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="If issues persist">
    **Generate comprehensive diagnostic report:**
    
    If the above troubleshooting steps don't resolve your issue, generate a diagnostic report to help our support team identify the problem:
    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://visiblsemi.com/api/diag-nl | sudo bash > diag-nl.log 2>&1
    ```
    
    This command collects system information, service logs, and configuration details into a `diag-nl.log` file.
    
    **Send the diagnostic report:**
    
    Email the generated `diag-nl.log` file to [support@visiblsemi.com](mailto:support@visiblsemi.com) along with a description of the issue you're experiencing.
    
    <Warning>
    The diagnostic script collects system information and service logs. Review the generated log file before sending to ensure it doesn't contain any sensitive information specific to your environment.
