Welcome to the API Reference section. Here you'll find comprehensive documentation for all available endpoints.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication. Include your API key in the header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint
```

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "Example"
  },
  "error": null
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error

Error responses include details:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "The request parameters are invalid"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are limited to 1000 requests per hour per API key.
