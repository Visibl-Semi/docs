# Visibl

Visibl is a enterprise AI-powered platform for silicon engineering teams. We provide enterprise-grade tools that accelerate chip design, verification, and documentation—while preserving security and control on your infrastructure.

<Callout type="info" title="Who is Visibl for?">
Chip, IP, and systems teams who need AI assistance without sending code or designs to external services. Built by silicon engineers for silicon engineers.
</Callout>

## What Visibl Does

Visibl combines two powerful components to transform how silicon engineering teams work:

### Local LLM Infrastructure
- **Enterprise-grade LLM service** running on your infrastructure
- **GPU-optimized models** specifically tuned for silicon engineering tasks
- **Complete data isolation** - no code or designs leave your network
- **Production-ready deployment** with systemd integration and monitoring

### AI-Powered CLI Agent
- **Context-aware assistant** that understands RTL, verification, and design flows
- **Silicon-specific knowledge** of industry tools, standards, and best practices
- **Integrated workflow** with your existing EDA tools and methodologies
- **Secure by design** - works entirely with your local LLM service

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy the LLM Service">
    Set up the local, OpenAI-compatible API on your servers with a one-line installer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    Install the Visibl CLI on your workstation; it auto-discovers and connects to your local service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build with AI">
    Use the CLI agent to generate RTL, create verification assets, automate flows, and document designs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The CLI agent can help with:
- RTL design and debugging
- Verification testbench creation
- Design documentation
- Tool integration and automation
- Code review and optimization

## Key Benefits

**Security**: All processing happens on your infrastructure—no external API calls.

**Performance**: GPU-optimized models deliver low-latency responses for complex engineering queries.

**Integration**: Works with your existing EDA tools, flows, and methodologies.

**Expertise**: Silicon-aware assistance grounded in industry standards and best practices.

<Callout type="success" title="Tip">
Start with the fast 7B model for day-to-day assistance. Switch to the 70B model when you need deeper reasoning for architecture and complex design decisions.
