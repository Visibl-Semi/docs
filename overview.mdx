# Visibl

Visibl is a professional AI-powered platform designed specifically for silicon engineering teams. We provide enterprise-grade tools that accelerate chip design, verification, and documentation workflows while maintaining security and control.

## What Visibl Does

Visibl combines two powerful components to transform how silicon engineering teams work:

### Local LLM Infrastructure
- **Enterprise-grade LLM service** running on your infrastructure
- **GPU-optimized models** specifically tuned for silicon engineering tasks
- **Complete data isolation** - no code or designs leave your network
- **Production-ready deployment** with systemd integration and monitoring

### AI-Powered CLI Agent
- **Context-aware assistant** that understands RTL, verification, and design flows
- **Silicon-specific knowledge** of industry tools, standards, and best practices
- **Integrated workflow** with your existing EDA tools and methodologies
- **Secure by design** - works entirely with your local LLM service

## How It Works

1. **Deploy the LLM Service** on your infrastructure using our one-line installer
2. **Install the CLI** which automatically connects to your local LLM service
3. **Start building** with an AI assistant that understands silicon engineering

The CLI agent can help with:
- RTL design and debugging
- Verification testbench creation
- Design documentation
- Tool integration and automation
- Code review and optimization

## Key Benefits

**Security**: All processing happens on your infrastructure. No external API calls.

**Performance**: GPU-optimized models provide fast responses for complex engineering queries.

**Integration**: Works with your existing tools, flows, and methodologies.

**Expertise**: Built by silicon engineers, for silicon engineers.
