---

The LLM service runs as background infrastructure. Most users interact through the Visibl CLI, not directly with the service.

## Service Commands

```bash
# Check status and GPU
visibl-smi

# View logs
visibl-llm logs -f

# Restart service
visibl-llm restart

# Stop service
visibl-llm stop

# Start service
visibl-llm start
```

## Switch Models

```bash
# Switch to Fast model
visibl-llm fast

# Switch to Expert model
visibl-llm expert

# Switch to Heavy model
visibl-llm heavy
```

The service will restart with the new model. This may take a few minutes.
