## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to the public.

### Edit locally

Install the CLI to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mint
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is):

```bash
mint dev
```

### Edit in the cloud

Click on any page to edit it in the browser. Our in-browser editor will save changes and show a preview automatically.

## Update your docs

Add content directly in your files with MDX syntax and React components. You can use any of our components, or even build your own.
