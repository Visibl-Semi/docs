# Agent

Autonomous AI agent that can automatically perform file operations, execute system commands, and interact with your development environment. The agent feature enables hands-free automation of complex silicon engineering workflows through intelligent tool calling.

<Info>
**Autonomous Operation**: The agent can automatically read files, write code, execute bash commands, and perform multi-step operations without manual intervention, while maintaining safety through approval workflows.
</Info>

## Quick Start

Enable agent mode for autonomous operations:

```bash
# Start agent with autonomous capabilities
visibl --agent

# Agent mode with specific task
visibl run --agent "Set up a complete UVM testbench environment for my UART module"
```

## Key Capabilities

### Automatic File Operations
- **File Reading** - Automatically reads and analyzes relevant files
- **Code Writing** - Creates and modifies multiple files simultaneously
- **Directory Management** - Creates folder structures and organizes files
- **File Synchronization** - Maintains consistency across related files
- **Backup Creation** - Automatically backs up files before modifications

### System Command Execution
- **Bash Commands** - Executes shell commands for build and test operations
- **Tool Integration** - Runs EDA tools (synthesis, simulation, formal verification)
- **Script Generation** - Creates and executes build scripts and makefiles
- **Environment Setup** - Configures development environments automatically
- **Process Management** - Handles long-running processes and background tasks

### Multi-Step Workflows
- **Project Setup** - Complete project initialization from scratch
- **Build Automation** - End-to-end build and verification flows
- **Code Refactoring** - Large-scale code modifications across multiple files
- **Documentation Generation** - Automated documentation creation and updates
- **Regression Testing** - Automated test suite execution and analysis

## Tool Calling Architecture

### Available Tools

**File System Tools:**
```bash
# Automatic file operations
read_file(path)           # Read and analyze files
write_file(path, content) # Create or modify files
list_directory(path)      # Explore project structure
create_directory(path)    # Set up folder structures
```

**Command Execution Tools:**
```bash
# System command execution
run_bash(command)         # Execute shell commands
run_eda_tool(tool, args)  # Launch EDA tools
check_syntax(file)        # Validate RTL syntax
run_simulation(testbench) # Execute simulations
```

**Development Tools:**
```bash
# Development workflow tools
git_operations(action)    # Version control operations
build_project(target)     # Project build automation
run_tests(test_suite)     # Test execution
generate_reports(type)    # Report generation
```

### Safety and Approval

**Approval Workflows:**
- **File Modifications** - Shows diffs before applying changes
- **Command Execution** - Displays commands before execution
- **Destructive Operations** - Requires explicit confirmation
- **Batch Operations** - Summarizes all planned actions

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- **Sandbox Mode** - Test operations in isolated environment
- **Rollback Capability** - Undo changes if issues occur
- **Permission Checks** - Validates file and system permissions
- **Resource Monitoring** - Prevents resource exhaustion

## Usage Examples

### Complete Project Setup

```bash
visibl run --agent "Create a complete RISC-V processor project with:
- 5-stage pipeline architecture
- Cache hierarchy (L1 I/D caches)
- Memory management unit
- Complete UVM testbench
- Synthesis and simulation scripts
- Documentation and build system"
```

**Agent automatically:**
1. Creates directory structure
2. Generates all RTL modules
3. Creates testbench environment
4. Sets up build scripts
5. Generates documentation
6. Configures version control

### Automated Verification Flow

```bash
visibl run --agent "Set up comprehensive verification for my cache controller:
- Create UVM testbench with all agents
- Generate directed and random tests
- Set up coverage collection
- Create regression test suite
- Generate verification plan document"
```

**Agent workflow:**
1. Analyzes existing cache controller RTL
2. Creates UVM environment with appropriate agents
3. Generates test scenarios based on cache functionality
4. Sets up coverage models and collection
5. Creates automated regression scripts
6. Generates comprehensive verification documentation

### Code Refactoring and Optimization

```bash
visibl run --agent "Refactor my processor design for better timing:
- Analyze critical paths
- Add pipeline stages where needed
- Update all testbenches
- Modify constraints
- Run timing analysis
- Generate timing report"
```

**Agent operations:**
1. Reads and analyzes all processor RTL files
2. Identifies timing-critical paths
3. Modifies RTL to add pipeline stages
4. Updates all related testbenches automatically
5. Modifies timing constraints
6. Runs synthesis and timing analysis
7. Generates comprehensive timing report

## Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Decision Making

**Intelligent File Selection:**
- Automatically identifies relevant files for tasks
- Understands module dependencies and relationships
- Selects appropriate testbenches and verification files
- Recognizes coding patterns and conventions

**Smart Command Generation:**
- Generates appropriate EDA tool commands
- Selects optimal tool options and settings
- Handles tool-specific syntax and requirements
- Manages tool licensing and resource allocation

### Multi-Tool Coordination

**EDA Tool Integration:**
```bash
# Agent coordinates multiple tools
synthesis_flow = [
    "read_design(rtl_files)",
    "elaborate_design(top_module)", 
    "apply_constraints(sdc_file)",
    "synthesize(target_library)",
    "generate_reports(timing, area, power)"
]
```

**Verification Tool Orchestration:**
```bash
# Automated verification flow
verification_flow = [
    "compile_rtl(design_files)",
    "compile_testbench(tb_files)",
    "run_simulation(test_suite)",
    "collect_coverage(coverage_db)",
    "generate_reports(coverage, regression)"
]
```

### Workflow Templates

**Predefined Workflows:**
- **New Project Setup** - Complete project initialization
- **Module Development** - RTL module creation and verification
- **Integration Testing** - System-level verification setup
- **Release Preparation** - Documentation, testing, and packaging
- **Performance Analysis** - Timing, power, and area optimization

**Custom Workflow Creation:**
```bash
visibl create-workflow "custom_flow" --steps [
    "analyze_requirements",
    "generate_architecture", 
    "implement_rtl",
    "create_verification",
    "run_regression",
    "generate_documentation"
]
```

## Configuration and Control

### Agent Settings

```bash
# Configure agent behavior
visibl config agent.auto_approve false    # Require approval for all actions
visibl config agent.backup_files true     # Automatically backup files
visibl config agent.max_operations 50     # Limit operations per session
visibl config agent.sandbox_mode true     # Enable sandbox testing
```

### Monitoring and Logging

**Operation Tracking:**
- Real-time operation status and progress
- Detailed logs of all file operations and commands
- Performance metrics and resource usage
- Error tracking and recovery actions

**Audit Trail:**
- Complete history of agent actions
- File modification timestamps and checksums
- Command execution logs with outputs
- Decision rationale and context information

## Best Practices

### Effective Agent Usage
- **Clear Objectives** - Provide specific, well-defined goals
- **Scope Definition** - Clearly outline what should and shouldn't be modified
- **Safety First** - Use approval mode for critical operations
- **Incremental Approach** - Break complex tasks into manageable steps

### Project Organization
- **Clean Structure** - Maintain organized directory structure
- **Version Control** - Use Git for tracking agent modifications
- **Documentation** - Keep project documentation up to date
- **Testing** - Validate agent-generated code thoroughly

### Security Considerations
