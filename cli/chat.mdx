## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive session
visibl

# Direct command
visibl run "Create an AXI4-Lite slave interface"

# Initialize project context
visibl init
```

## Project Context

### Initialize Your Workspace

Run `visibl init` at your workspace root to generate an `AGENTS.md` file:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/rtl/project
visibl init
```

This creates `AGENTS.md` with context about your project:
- Build flows and workflows
- EDA tools and commands
- Linting and style guidelines
- Coding standards
- Project-specific conventions

The CLI uses this context to provide more relevant and accurate assistance.

## Key Features

- **Project Context**: Understands your codebase structure and relationships
- **RTL Generation**: Creates SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL code
- **File Operations**: Reads, creates, and modifies files intelligently
- **Command Execution**: Runs build scripts, EDA tools, and automation
- **Interactive Refinement**: Iterative improvement through conversation

## Usage Modes

### Interactive Mode

```bash
visibl
```

Have conversations about complex design tasks:

```
> Create a FIFO with gray code pointers
> Add overflow/underflow protection  
> Generate a testbench for this FIFO
```

The CLI can automatically:
- Read and analyze relevant files
- Create and modify multiple files
- Execute build and verification commands
- Maintain consistency across your project

### Direct Commands

```bash
visibl run "Create a 4-stage pipeline processor with hazard detection"
visibl run "Review my cache controller for timing optimization"
```

## Context Understanding

The CLI analyzes your project to understand:
- Module hierarchy and interface dependencies
- Clock domain relationships and timing constraints
- Protocol requirements (AXI, PCIe, DDR, etc.)
- Build flows and EDA tool commands (from `AGENTS.md`)
- Coding standards and design patterns

## Best Practices

**Initialize Your Project**: Run `visibl init` at workspace root. Keep `AGENTS.md` updated with build flows and EDA tool commands.

**Be Specific**: Provide detailed requirements, constraints, and references to existing modules. Mention coding standards.

**Iterate**: Start with core functionality, refine through conversation, validate generated code.

## Example Workflows

**Complex Design Tasks**
```bash
visibl
> Implement MESI cache coherency for 4-core system with L2 arbiter
> Add timing constraints for cross-domain paths
> Generate UVM testbench with coherency checking
```

**Multi-File Refactoring**
```bash
visibl
> Add pipeline stage between decode and execute in my RISC-V core
> Update hazard_unit.sv and forwarding_unit.sv accordingly
> Modify testbench to verify new pipeline timing
```

The CLI handles coordinated changes across your entire project while maintaining correctness.

## Safety

All file operations and commands are shown for review before execution. You can approve, modify, or reject any proposed changes.
