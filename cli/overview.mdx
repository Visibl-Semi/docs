# Visibl CLI

The Visibl CLI is an AI-powered coding assistant for silicon engineering teams. It delivers context-aware help for RTL design, verification, documentation, and EDA tool integration—running against your local Visibl LLM Service.

<Callout type="warning" title="Privacy first">
The CLI never sends your code or designs to external APIs. All inference happens on your infrastructure via the local Visibl LLM Service.
</Callout>

## What It Does

The Visibl CLI acts as your AI pair programmer, understanding:
- **RTL Languages**: Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL
- **Verification**: UVM, SystemC, formal verification
- **EDA Tools**: Synopsys, Cadence, Mentor workflows
- **Design Flows**: Synthesis, P&R, timing analysis
- **Industry Standards**: AXI, PCIe, DDR, USB protocols

## Key Features

### Context-Aware Assistance
- **Project Understanding**: Analyzes your entire codebase for context
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides relevant solutions based on your design
- **Code Generation**: Creates RTL, testbenches, and constraints
- **Bug Detection**: Identifies common design and verification issues

### Silicon Engineering Expertise
- **RTL Best Practices**: Follows industry coding standards
- **Synthesis Awareness**: Generates synthesizable, optimized code
- **Timing Considerations**: Understands clock domains and timing constraints
- **Verification Patterns**: Creates comprehensive testbenches and assertions

### Integrated Workflow
- **File Operations**: Read, write, and edit files in your project
- **Tool Integration**: Execute EDA tools and analyze results
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain design documentation
- **Code Review**: Analyze code for quality and compliance

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connects to your local service">
    Uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint exposed by the Visibl LLM Service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understands your project">
    Analyzes your repository structure, technologies, and design constraints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assists in natural language">
    Generates RTL, testbenches, constraints, scripts, and documentation with silicon-aware guidance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Executes tasks safely">
    Reads/writes files and runs commands you approve—keeping changes local.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security & Privacy

- **Local processing**: All AI inference happens on your infrastructure
- **No external calls**: Zero data sent to third-party services
- **Project isolation**: Operates within your development environment
- **Secure by design**: Aligns with enterprise security requirements

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Use smaller, focused prompts tied to specific files or modules to get the most accurate, synthesizable RTL and verification assets.
</Callout>

## Common Use Cases

### RTL Development
- Generate module templates and interfaces
- Debug timing issues and synthesis warnings
- Optimize code for area and performance
- Create comprehensive documentation

### Verification
- Build UVM testbenches and environments
- Generate directed and random test cases
- Create assertions and coverage models
- Debug simulation failures

### Integration & Automation
- Create build and simulation scripts
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Generate reports and metrics
