# Visibl CLI

The Visibl CLI is an AI-powered coding assistant built specifically for silicon engineering teams. It provides context-aware help with RTL design, verification, documentation, and EDA tool integration.

## What It Does

The Visibl CLI acts as your AI pair programmer, understanding:
- **RTL Languages**: Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL
- **Verification**: UVM, SystemC, formal verification
- **EDA Tools**: Synopsys, Cadence, Mentor workflows
- **Design Flows**: Synthesis, P&R, timing analysis
- **Industry Standards**: AXI, PCIe, DDR, USB protocols

## Key Features

### Context-Aware Assistance
- **Project Understanding**: Analyzes your entire codebase for context
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides relevant solutions based on your design
- **Code Generation**: Creates RTL, testbenches, and constraints
- **Bug Detection**: Identifies common design and verification issues

### Silicon Engineering Expertise
- **RTL Best Practices**: Follows industry coding standards
- **Synthesis Awareness**: Generates synthesizable, optimized code
- **Timing Considerations**: Understands clock domains and timing constraints
- **Verification Patterns**: Creates comprehensive testbenches and assertions

### Integrated Workflow
- **File Operations**: Read, write, and edit files in your project
- **Tool Integration**: Execute EDA tools and analyze results
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain design documentation
- **Code Review**: Analyze code for quality and compliance

## How It Works

1. **Connects** to your local Visibl LLM Service for complete privacy
2. **Analyzes** your project structure and design context
3. **Provides** intelligent assistance through natural language interaction
4. **Executes** tasks directly in your development environment

## Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All AI inference happens on your infrastructure
- **No External Calls**: Zero data sent to external services
- **Project Isolation**: Works entirely within your development environment
- **Secure by Design**: Built for enterprise security requirements

## Common Use Cases

### RTL Development
- Generate module templates and interfaces
- Debug timing issues and synthesis warnings
- Optimize code for area and performance
- Create comprehensive documentation

### Verification
- Build UVM testbenches and environments
- Generate directed and random test cases
- Create assertions and coverage models
- Debug simulation failures

### Integration & Automation
- Create build and simulation scripts
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Generate reports and metrics
