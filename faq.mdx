<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How does Visibl protect my IP and design data?">
   
    For maximum IP protection, we offer 100% local processing options:
    - **On-device**: All AI processing happens locally on your machine
    - **On-premises server**: Deploy Visibl on your own infrastructure 
    - **Air-gapped environments**: Full offline operation for maximum security
    ---
     Visibl offers multiple deployment options based on your data sensitivity requirements:
    - **Public models**: Connect to traditional cloud AI services if you're not data sensitive
    
    
    Your RTL, verification code, and design documentation never touch external servers unless you explicitly enable and choose public models.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own AI models and API providers?">
    Yes! Visibl provides full API provider control. You can:
    - Connect to traditional endpoints if you're not data sensitive and want to use large foundational models served by others
    
    ---
    
    - Connect to your own cloud provider or custom API endpoints
    - Use locally hosted models like Gemma, Llama, CodeLlama, or StarCoder
    - Configure different models for different tasks (code generation, documentation, verification)
    - Set up model routing based on project sensitivity levels
    
    This gives you complete control over costs, performance, and data handling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What HDL languages and verification methodologies does Visibl support?">
    Visibl works with all major hardware description languages and verification frameworks:
    - **HDLs**: SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL, Chisel, SpinalHDL
    - **Verification**: UVM, SVA, PSL, Cocotb, formal verification
    - **High-level synthesis**: HLS C++, Bluespec
    - **Documentation**: Markdown, reStructuredText, Sphinx integration
    
    Our AI models are specifically trained on chip design patterns and best practices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you keep the AI models up-to-date with latest standards and IP?">
    Visibl leverages the latest foundational models like Claude 4, o3 and the suite of on-prem models we configure for your users, enhanced with chip design expertise. 
    
    Integration of external documentations and @web search coming soon to enable access to the most current standard information. We're keeping our eye on emerging standards like RISC-V extensions, UCIe, and CXL protocols.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I share context between multiple chip projects and IP blocks?">
    Currently, the simplest method is to place related repositories in the same directory and launch Visibl from there. This allows cross-referencing between:
    - Different IP blocks in the same SoC
    - Testbench and RTL repositories  
    - Documentation and implementation
    
    We're actively developing improved support for managing multiple project hierarchies and IP dependencies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Visibl integrate with EDA tools and design flows?">
    Coming soon! Contact hi@visiblsemi.com to request integration with your specific EDA tools and design flows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Visibl handle large codebases and complex SoC designs?">
    Visibl is optimized for large-scale chip designs:
    - **Incremental indexing**: Only re-index changed files for fast updates
    - **Hierarchical navigation**: Browse complex module hierarchies efficiently  
    - **Selective context**: Include only relevant modules in AI conversations
    - **Memory optimization**: Handle multi-million gate designs without performance issues
    
    Visibl's codebase indexing proposes no limits - we automatically adjust to serve any design size or complexity. If you encounter any issues, contact [hi@visiblsemi.com](mailto:hi@visiblsemi.com).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do Visibl updates work?">
    Visibl provides automatic updates with rollback capability. Updates never compromise your data privacy or require external connectivity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why haven't I received the latest release yet?">
    All users receive automatic updates within 15 mins - 1 hour of release. Update rollouts are gradual to ensure stability.
    
    You can manually check for updates in Settings â†’ About.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I delete my data?">
    Data deletion depends on your deployment:
    - **Local/on-premises**: Simply delete the application data folder
    - **Cloud deployment**: Contact [hi@visiblsemi.com](mailto:hi@visiblsemi.com) for account deletion
    - **Hybrid setups**: Local data is deleted automatically; cloud data requires request
    
    All cached models and indices are stored locally and removed with uninstallation.
