# Rate Limits

Learn about the rate limits that apply to your Visibl account.

## Current Limits

Your current rate limits based on your plan:

| Resource | Limit | Period | Current Usage |
|----------|-------|--------|---------------|
| API Requests | 1,000 | Per hour | 234/1,000 |
| Tokens | 100,000 | Per day | 45,231/100,000 |
| Document Builds | 50 | Per day | 12/50 |
| Storage | 5 GB | Total | 2.3 GB/5 GB |

## Rate Limit Types

### API Rate Limits
- **Requests per minute**: Maximum API calls per minute
- **Tokens per day**: Total tokens across all models
- **Concurrent requests**: Simultaneous API calls

### Resource Limits
- **Storage**: Total file storage capacity
- **Builds**: Documentation build operations
- **Team members**: Number of users in your account

## Monitoring Usage

<Tip>
Monitor your usage regularly to avoid hitting rate limits during peak times.
</Tip>

### Usage Dashboard
View real-time usage in your account dashboard:
- Current usage vs. limits
- Historical usage patterns
- Peak usage times
- Upgrade recommendations

### Alerts
Set up alerts when you reach:
- 80% of your limit
- 90% of your limit
- Custom thresholds

## Handling Rate Limits

### Best Practices
- Implement exponential backoff
- Cache responses when possible
- Use batch operations
- Monitor usage patterns

### Error Responses

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```
