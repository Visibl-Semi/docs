## Installation Options

### npm

```bash
npm install -g visibl
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn global add visibl
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -g visibl
```

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have the following structure:

```
my-docs/
├── mint.json          # Configuration file
├── introduction.mdx   # Home page
├── api-reference/     # API documentation
│   └── ...
├── essentials/        # Core documentation
│   └── ...
└── logo/             # Logo assets
    ├── light.svg
    └── dark.svg
```

## Configuration

The `mint.json` file contains all your documentation settings:

```json
{
  "name": "My Documentation",
  "logo": {
    "dark": "/logo/dark.svg",
    "light": "/logo/light.svg"
  },
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#000000",
    "light": "#FFFFFF"
  }
}
```

## Common Commands

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
visibl dev

# Start on a specific port
visibl dev --port 3001
```

### Build

```bash
# Build for production
visibl build

# Preview production build
visibl preview
```

### Update

```bash
# Update Visibl to latest version
visibl update
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    If port 3000 is already in use, Visibl will automatically try the next available port. You can also specify a port manually:
    
    ```bash
    visibl dev --port 3001
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission errors">
    If you encounter permission errors during global installation, try using a package manager that doesn't require sudo:
    
    ```bash
    npx visibl init my-docs
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Module not found">
    Clear your npm cache and reinstall:
    
    ```bash
    npm cache clean --force
    npm install -g visibl
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
