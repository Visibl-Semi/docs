    If you want the AI to talk to you in a different language, you can enter the name of the language you want to use. This can be configured further in the rules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keyboard shortcuts" icon="keyboard">
    If you are coming from a different editor, you can choose the default shortcuts you want to start with, so they are as familiar as possible.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Codebase Indexing" icon="database">
    All indexing is local - Visibl indexes your codebase locally on your machine to provide better AI suggestions while keeping your code private.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CLI Shortcuts" icon="terminal">

After configuring these settings, you will have the option to import your VS Code settings in one click. If you accept, this will import your extensions, themes, user settings, and keyboard shortcuts into Visibl, so you can get started right away.

Next, you'll be asked about your data preference. To learn more about this, and make an informed decision, read more about our dedicated [privacy page](/privacy).
