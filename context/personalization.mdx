# Personalization

Create personalized documentation experiences that adapt to each user's needs and context.

## Overview

Personalization allows you to show relevant content based on:
- User role and permissions
- Previous interactions
- Preferences and settings
- Geographic location

## Personalization Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Role-based Content" icon="users">
    Show content based on user roles
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Examples" icon="code">
    Customize code examples and configs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Regional Content" icon="globe">
    Localized information and settings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progress Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    Show user's learning progress
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Implementation

### Role-based Content

```markdown
{% if user.role == "admin" %}
## Admin Configuration
Administrative settings and options...
{% elif user.role == "developer" %}
## Developer Setup
Development environment configuration...
{% endif %}
```

### Dynamic Code Examples

```javascript
// Personalized API example
const apiKey = "{{user.api_key}}";
const endpoint = "{{user.region}}.api.visiblsemi.com";

fetch(`https://${endpoint}/data`, {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Balance personalization with simplicity - too much customization can make documentation confusing.
</Tip>

- Start with basic role-based content
- Test personalization with different user types
- Provide fallbacks for missing data
- Keep personalized content up-to-date
- Monitor which personalizations are most effective
