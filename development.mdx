<Info>
**Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mint
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the directory containing your documentation:

```bash
cd path/to/your/docs
```

Step 3. Run the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the --port flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on.

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different from production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mint
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm up --global mint
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
Unlimited editors available under the [Startup Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when developing the documentation locally.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify dev isn't running - port is already taken">
    **Diagnosis**: You are already running a Mintlify instance in a different terminal session.

    **Solution**: Find the existing instance and terminate it, or switch to a different port using the `--port` flag.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify dev is running but my changes aren't being applied">
    **Diagnosis**: You are editing docs in Mintlify web editor at the same time you are running Mintlify locally.

    **Solution**: Changes from the web editor need to be pulled and merged with changes made locally.
